            <li>1/2 pound 93% lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 pound hot Italian sausage</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Calabrian chili paste, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chiles</li>
            <li>22 ounces marinara sauce </li>
            <li>1 ounce creme fraiche</li>
            <li>1 cup fat-free half-and-half</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>8 ounces pearl mozzarella, broken into pieces</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. <br>
                Stir in rigatoni and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered for 7 minutes, <br>
                stirring occasionally. Drain.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, add olive oil and butter to a heavy cast iron or other ovenproof skillet. <br>
                When butter is melted, add onion to the skillet, and sauté until translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. <br>
                Add mushrooms, and sauté until softened, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add beef and sausage. Cook, breaking up meat with a spatula, until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add garlic, Calabrian chile paste, and RoTel. Sauté for about 1 minute. Stir in marinara sauce. <br>
                Stir in crème fraîche, half-and-half, and whipping cream. Fold in rigatoni until combined; <br>
                fold in half of mozzarella. Scatter remaining mozzarella on top of skillet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, about 30 minutes. <br>
                Scatter parsley over top. Serve immediately.</li>
